## Spamfilter
**A Naive Bayesian spam classifier in Python**

This is a reimplementation of my previous spamfilter that I had written in Ruby.

The docstrings may be a little overkill for this simple class but I was messing around with Sphynx, thus this project is fully documented

I will post performance comparisons of the two implementations using the full spam assassin dataset. I have once again included a small testing and training email directory in this repository.
