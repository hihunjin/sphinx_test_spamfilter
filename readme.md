## Spamfilter
**A Naive Bayesian spam classifier in Python**

This is a reimplementation of my previous spamfilter that I had written in Ruby.

I will post performance comparisons of the two implementations using the full spam assassin dataset. I have once again included a small testing and training email directory in this repository.

At the moment, the email directory is hardcoded and uses *nix pathnames.
